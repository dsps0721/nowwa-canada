  **Design Movement**: Modern Minimalist with Vibrant Accents (Neo-Brutalism influence)
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Bold Clarity**: High contrast, large typography, and clear hierarchy.
  2. **Energetic Warmth**: Using the brand's signature orange to inject energy into a clean, white/neutral base.
  3. **Product-Centric**: High-quality imagery of the coffee and fruit drinks as the focal points.
  4. **Direct & Honest**: Simple, direct messaging that aligns with the "no-nonsense" business opportunity.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Nowwa Orange (#FF6B00) - Represents energy, youth, and the "fruit coffee" innovation.
  - **Secondary**: Crisp White (#FFFFFF) & Deep Charcoal (#1A1A1A) - Provides a clean, professional canvas.
  - **Accent**: Soft Cream (#F9F5F0) - Adds warmth and approachability.
  - **Reasoning**: The orange needs to pop against a clean background to create a "fresh" and "modern" feel, avoiding the clutter of traditional franchise sites.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Asymmetric Grids**: Breaking the standard 12-column grid with overlapping elements and large image blocks.
  - **Split-Screen Hero**: One side for bold typography, the other for immersive product imagery.
  - **Sticky Navigation**: Keeps the "Join Us" CTA always accessible.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **The "Orange Slice"**: A subtle, abstract geometric shape derived from an orange slice, used as a background pattern or divider.
  - **Floating Product Cards**: Drink images that slightly float/parallax on scroll.
  - **Bold Borders**: Thin, crisp black borders around key sections to define structure (Neo-Brutalism touch).

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Hover States**: Buttons fill with orange, images zoom slightly.
  - **Scroll-Triggered Reveal**: Text and images slide in from different directions to create dynamism.
  - **Micro-Interactions**: subtle bounce effects on icons.

  **Animation**:
  - **Entrance**: Staggered fade-up for text, smooth scale-up for images.
  - **Scroll**: Parallax effect on background patterns.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Oswald** (Bold, Uppercase) - Strong, impactful, modern.
  - **Body**: **Inter** (Regular, Clean) - Highly readable, professional.
  - **Pairing Rule**: Large, condensed headings paired with spacious, geometric body text for maximum contrast.

# Selected Design Philosophy: Modern Minimalist with Vibrant Accents (Idea 1)

**Reasoning**: This style best balances the "energy" of the Nowwa brand (fruit coffee, youth) with the "professionalism" required for a franchise/B2B website. It's clean enough to build trust with investors but vibrant enough to show the brand's consumer appeal. It avoids the "heaviness" of the organic style and the "coldness" of the tech style.

**Implementation Plan**:
- **Font**: Oswald for headings, Inter for body.
- **Colors**: Nowwa Orange (#FF6B00) as the hero, White/Charcoal for structure.
- **Visuals**: High-quality product shots + clean layout.
